# Minecraft Commercialize

A highly integrated commerce mod for Minecraft. Introduces a server-wide goods market of player-created and procedurally generated item offers, a shipping box to auto-sell items on a configurable interval (like the Stardew Valley Shipping Bin), and a posting box to post items to the market for other players to buy. Integrates deeply with [*Create: Numismatics*](https://modrinth.com/mod/numismatics) and [*MrCrayfish's Furniture Refurbished](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/refurbished-furniture) to offer cash and card payments and deposits, and an advanced mail and delivery system. This mod is an original work and a collaborative project created by Saint with custom model and texture work by Mezu. 

Developed for Saint's [Project Haze](https://haze.blockworlds.io/), a finely rebalanced survival mod pack with a vision.
